When you use materials from CartaBinaria, Informabot, or any of the other free tools at your disposal, you enjoy the fruit of other people's hard work. There are many ways to say "thank you" to them, even without writing a single line of code. Let's start with the simplest...

## Reporting an Issue or Proposing Something New

If you notice an issue or want to suggest an addition, just open an issue. For example, if you notice an error in the solution to an Operating Systems exam, you can click on "Issues" in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cartabinaria/sistemi-operativi) related to it. If you think that Informabot needs a new command, you can do the same, always in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cartabinaria/informabot) linked to it.

These small gestures are as quick as writing a message, and they don't commit you in any way to take care of it personally (although it's always appreciated).

## Adding Resources and/or Resolving Issues

Both teaching resources and all CartaBinaria code are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/cartabinaria). Once you've identified the project you want to contribute to, you can open a Pull Request (PR). If you don't know how, you can follow [this guide](../raccolte-di-risorse/contribuire-a-un-insegnamento/).

## Proposing a New Tool

If what you want to propose is an entirely new tool, not an improvement to something already present, you can click on "Discussions" from the [CartaBinaria GitHub page](https://github.com/cartabinaria). In this case, it's expected that you actively collaborate in the development of the project in question. If the proposal generates enough enthusiasm, you and your collaborators can get to work on a new CartaBinaria repository. If you need a free and always active server, the [ADMStaff group](https://admstaff.students.cs.unibo.it) will be happy to provide it, while [the system administrators of CartaBinaria](https://github.com/orgs/cartabinaria/teams/sistemisti) will take care of maintenance.

## Becoming a Maintainer

[CartaBinaria maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/cartabinaria/people) serve other students to moderate their contributions and provide them with support, divided into [groups](https://github.com/orgs/cartabinaria/teams) based on their interests. No previous experience is required because we offer complete training. We are always looking for new interested people!

## Help! I want to help, but I have no ideas...

If you already have a particular repository you'd like to contribute to, you can open it, click on "Issues," and check if there's any task to be done.

If you have nothing specific in mind, you can find [here](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+user%3Acartabinaria+) a list of all open issues among the various CartaBinaria repositories.

If this list seems too scattered, you can consult the [CartaBinaria projects](https://github.com/orgs/cartabinaria/projects), organic collections of issues organized by theme.
